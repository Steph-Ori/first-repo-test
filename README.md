## Project Description
This was a homework assignment during a previous Java class, it compares the volumes of two shapes: Cuboid and Cylinder.  
It was to help show and practice Java object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and method overriding.

---

## Concepts Used
- **Abstract Class (`Shape3D`)** – defines `Volume()` and `compareTo()`  
- **Inheritance** – `Cuboid` and `Cylinder` extend `Shape3D`  
- **Encapsulation** – private for shape dimensions  
- **Method Overriding** – each shape implements its own `Volume()` calculation   

---

## Inputs
- In `Main.java`:  
  - Cuboid → width = 8, depth = 12, height = 95  
  - Cylinder → radius = 30, height = 59  

## Outputs
A Console message showing which shape has the greater volume or if they are equal.
